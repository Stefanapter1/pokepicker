 Random pokemon selector for the games

The aim of this website is for me to practice using my skills taught through vairous courses into a fun, well designed, functional website.

The websites aims is for people to be able to select 6 random pokemeon with their stats, either for fun or as a challenge that they have to use in the games to complete it with.

Key issues that currently need adressing are:

- The functionality of the buttons
- The button design and overall size of the divs on the page
- Non existing javascript code for stats to be accessed and also brought up on the page.
